A repository of different data science project I have been working on.<br>
Each project is stored in folder named after its project name. The details of what the project is about are in the readme file for each folder.<br>
Each project folder contains sub folders such as data and figures.<br>
A jupyter notebook named after the project name will be present inside the project folder where we discuss the project details and findings.<br>
The Directory structure is as follows.<br>
